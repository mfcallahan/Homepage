# Matt Callahan's Homepage

## [mfcallahan.com](https://mfcallahan.com)

This repo contains my homepage, built with Angular 9 and deployed to GitHub Pages. View the source code here, and feel free to use any or all of it to help build your own Angular application.

My homepage was previously built using C# and ASP.NET MVC, prior to being rewritten with TypeScript and Angular. That source code can be viewed on branch [homepage-asp-net](https://github.com/mfcallahan/Homepage/tree/homepage-asp-net).
