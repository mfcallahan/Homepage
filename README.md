# Matt Callahan's Homepage

## [mfcallahan.com](https://mfcallahan.com)

This repo contains my homepage, built with TypeScript and Angular 11, and is deployed to GitHub Pages. View the source code here, and feel free to use any or all of it to help build your own Angular application.

My homepage was previously built with ASP.NET MVC. That source code can be viewed on branch [homepage-asp-net](https://github.com/mfcallahan/Homepage/tree/homepage-asp-net).
