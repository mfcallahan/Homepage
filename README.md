# Matt Callahan Homepage

## mfcallahan.com

This repo contains my homepage, built with Angular 8 and deployed with GitHub Pages. View the source code here, and feel free to use any or all of it to help build your own Angular application.

This page was previously built using ASP.NET MVC; that source code can be viewed on branch [home-age-asp-net](https://github.com/mfcallahan/Homepage/tree/homepage-asp-net)
