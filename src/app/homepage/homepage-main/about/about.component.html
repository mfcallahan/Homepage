<p>
  Hi, Iâ€™m Matt Callahan and I am a software engineer in Phoenix, Arizona. Computers have been my hobby since my dad
  bought our first family computer 30 years ago - a 286 IBM PC clone running MS-DOS. I found
  <span class="lightbox-link" href="assets/images/qbasic.png" (click)="open(0)">QBasic</span> on that computer and began
  teaching myself how to program. (Without Google or StackOverflow!) After receiving a
  <span class="lightbox-link" href="assets/images/ti83.png" (click)="open(1)">TI-83</span> graphing calculator for
  algebra class in 6th grade, I quickly began making games and homework cheat programs with
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-BASIC/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TI-BASIC</a> to share with friends.
  My interest in programming extended through college, where my Geographic Information Systems major introduced me to
  Java, Python, and ActionScript + Flash.
</p>
<p>
  If I'm not at my keyboard, you'll find me enjoying the Arizona outdoors - exploring the scenic back roads, bicycling,
  fishing, camping, swimming, and skiing (yes, there's skiing in
  <a href="https://snowbowl.ski/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arizona</a>).

<p>
  My main area of interest in programming is desktop and back end web development using the Microsoft
  <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/get-started/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >.NET framework</a
  >. C# is my language of choice when I need to develop a custom solution. It is a powerful language with a robust base
  class library and awesome features like LINQ, garbage collection, and asynchronous programming.
</p>
<p>
  Sometimes I just don't need the overhead of the massive .NET framework, and
  <a href="https://www.python.org/doc/essays/blurb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Python</a> is another favorite
  language. It is the perfect language for me to automate repetitive tasks or process large batches of data. Python is
  also what I strongly recommend as a first language to learn for programming beginners.
</p>
<p>
  I am also an
  <a href="https://angular.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Angular</a> developer, and have made this my front end
  framework of choice for developing web applications. The provided command line tools, integrated testing framework,
  and being built around <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TypeScript</a> make
  this a framework with which I greatly enjoy working.
</p>
<p>
  I bring all these areas of interest together in my current role as a Software Engineer at Republic Services in
  Scottsdale, Arizona. See my
  <a href="assets/docs/Matthew_Callahan_resume.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resume</a> for more information about
  my professional experience.

  In addition to computers and programming, my other nerdy hobby is radio. I am a licensed GMRS radio operator (call

      This is a sample REST API, built with .NET Core 3.1 and hosted on Azure as an App Service. This project is
      intended to demonstrate the patterns and best practices I like to leverage in the back end software I develop,
      including dependency injection, unit testing, and clean code organization. This application also includes
      interactive documentation, built with Swagger/Swashbuckle, which can be used to test the API in a browser.

      As a Software Engineer, I like to mentor team members and help others understand programming concepts. This mini
      project was created to provide a basic, practical demonstration of an asynchronous programming pattern in C# and
      highlight the performance gains that can be achieved.

      This repository contains an app to demonstrate the capabilities of SignalR, which provides real-time communication
      between the client and server. I was having some difficulty finding thorough examples of how to use SignalR, so I
      wrote a tutorial in a blog post demonstrating a simple implementation of SignalR in .NET Core 3.1 and Angular 10.

      This project is a
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapBasic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MapBasic</a> module and .NET
      library that extended MapInfo programming functionality by exposing .NET and Win32 API calls as easy to use
      MapBasic functions and subs. This was the first library I ever wrote and was a great learning experience in how to
      document, release, and support an open source software project, albeit on a small scale. I have long since ended
      work on this project, but I'm sharing it here to show how my career and code quality has progressed.
