<p>
  Hi, Iâ€™m Matt Callahan and I like programming. Computers have been my hobby since my dad bought our first family
  computer 30 years ago - a 286 IBM PC clone running MS-DOS. I found
  <span class="lightbox-link" href="assets/images/qbasic.png" (click)="open(0)">QBasic</span> on that computer and began
  teaching myself how to program. (Without Google or StackOverflow!) After receiving a
  <span class="lightbox-link" href="assets/images/ti83.png" (click)="open(1)">TI-83</span> graphing calculator for
  algebra class in 6th grade, I quickly began making games and homework cheat programs with
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-BASIC/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TI-BASIC</a> to share with friends.
  My interest in programming extended through college, where my Geographic Information Systems major introduced me to
  Java, Python, and ActionScript + Flash. I am currently an Engineering Manager at a software consultancy, overseeing a team
  which designs and builds custom software for clients. See my
  <a href="assets/docs/Matthew_Callahan_resume.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resume</a> for more information about my
  professional experience.

</a>
<p>
  My main area of interest in programming is desktop and back end web development using the Microsoft
  <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/get-started/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >.NET framework</a
  >. C# is my language of choice when I need to develop a custom solution. It is a powerful language with a robust base
  class library and awesome features like LINQ, dependency injection, asynchronous programming, and garbage collection.
</p>
<p>
  Sometimes I just don't need the overhead of the massive .NET framework, and
  <a href="https://www.python.org/doc/essays/blurb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Python</a> is another favorite
  language. It is the perfect language for me to automate repetitive tasks or process large batches of data. Python is
  also what I strongly recommend as a first language to learn for programming beginners.
</p>
<p>
  I am also an
  <a href="https://angular.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Angular</a> developer, and have made this my preferred
  front end framework for developing web applications. The provided command line tools, integrated testing framework,
  and being built around <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TypeScript</a> make
  this a framework with which I greatly enjoy working.
</p>
<!-- <p>
  I also like to explore new topics and learn unfamiliar languages/frameworks. Right now, I'm learning
  <a href="https://golang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Go</a>. I'm also learning more about home networking,
  experimenting with <a href="https://pi-hole.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pi-hole</a>.

  In addition to computers and programming, my other nerdy hobby is radio. I am a licensed GMRS radio operator (call

      interactive documentation, automatically generated with Swagger/Swashbuckle, which can be used to test the API in

      When using the <a href="https://github.com/Esri/esri-loader/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">esri-loader</a> and
      the
      <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ArcGIS API for JavaScript</a>
      inside an Angular application, I ran into an issue writing unit tests: the API modules are lazy loaded at run time
      and HTTP requests are made to fetch the resources, but I needed to mock this behavior in tests. This app
      demonstrates an approach for testing code which has a dependency on the esri-loader. Using dependency injection
      and the Facade pattern, an abstraction for the methods which load the API modules can be created. This allows the
      esri-loader dependency to be more easily mocked, and eliminates actual HTTP requests being made in a unit test.
