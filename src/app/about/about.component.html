<h2><fa-icon [icon]="faUser"></fa-icon>About Me</h2>
<p>
  Hi, Iâ€™m Matt Callahan and I am a software developer in Phoenix, Arizona. Computers have been my hobby since my dad brought home our first
  family computer 30 years ago - a 286 PC running MS-DOS. I found <a href="../../assets/images/qbasic.png">QBasic</a> and began teaching
  myself how to program - without Google or StackOverflow! After receiving a <a href="../../assets/images/ti83.png">TI-83</a> graphing
  calculator for algebra class in 6th grade, I quickly began making games and homework cheat programs with
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-BASIC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TI-BASIC</a> to share with friends. My interest in
  programming extended through college, where my Geographic Information Systems major introduced me to Java, and Flash/ActionScript.

  If I'm not at my keyboard, you'll find me enjoying the Arizona outdoors - exploring the scenic back roads, bicycling, fishing, camping,
  swimming, and skiing (yes, there's skiing in <a href="https://www.arizonasnowbowl.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arizona</a>).
